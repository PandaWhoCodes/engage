create a simple UI 
that will basically convert - /Users/ashish/Documents/PERSONAL/discord_personality_check/src/engagement/message_generator.py
into a standalone app 
ready to be deployed to fly.dev

Copy anything and everything needed from the above project including the .env file
shadcn UI -> simple -> mobile friendly-> generate button 
gives generated content
i have another project called assistomatic in PERSONAL folder
that basically shows how i want to package things such that everything runs in one docker image
python backend and the frontend

optimized properly so it doesnt cost me too much
